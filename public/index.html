Follow me and you will have eternal life.3. You are valuable and loved.4. I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.5. Come to me and I will give you rest.</h1><p>In these five short statements, Jesus makes some pretty amazing claims. Let’s take a look at them one by one.</p>
<ol>
<li>“I will always be with you.”</li>
</ol>
<p>This statement from Jesus is both comforting and reassuring. He assures us that we will never be alone, no matter what happens in this life. This promise from Jesus is something we can cling to when times are tough.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>“Follow me and you will have eternal life.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus offers us eternal life as a reward for following Him. What could be better than spending eternity with our Heavenly Father? It’s definitely something worth striving for!</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>“You are valuable and loved.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus tells us that we are valuable and loved, simply because we are created in His image. This should give us a sense of worth and purpose, no matter what others may say or think about us. We are loved by God, and that is the most important thing!</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>“I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus is the only way to know God and to have eternal life. There is no other path that leads to salvation. This is something Christians believe wholeheartedly!</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>“Come to me and I will give you rest.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus offers us rest and peace, not only in this life but also in eternity. When we come to Him with our burdens, He gives us relief and consoles us. What a precious gift!</p>
